# Checkbook Web Application
This is a web-based application used for managing "checkbook" transaction entries. There is also functionality for budgeting.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
The following software needs to be installed:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - for managing the repositories
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - for managing packages used by the web application
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) - for building the API project
* [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows) - for compiling the project

### Installing

#### Download the repository
Next we will pull the API and web application repositories.

```
cd <path where you store source code for sites>
git clone https://github.com/sumtech/checkbook.git Checkbook
```

Setup the startup projects:
* In the solution Explorer, right-click on the solution.
* Click "Set StartUp Projects..."
* Select "Multiple startup projects"
* For Checkbook.Api and Checkbook.Web, select "Start"
* Click "OK"

#### Initial Build
Build the project using "Build" > "Build Solution"

Launch the project using "Debug" > "Start without Debugging" or using Ctrl+F5. This will cause two tabs to open up in your browser: one for the API and one for the application.
